            <li>Magic Forest is a multiplayer virtual reality game with a soothing, mystical atmosphere where players can reflect and store their thoughts while connecting with their friends.</li>
            <li>The project is a collaboration between <a href="http://dang-brandon.com/">Brandon Dang</a>, <a href="http://dawnuxi.com/">Dawn Nguyen</a>, and myself.</li>
            <li>Our goal is to create a virtual space that promotes the user's mental health and helps them make meaningful connections with other people.</li>
            <li>Weâ€™re currently developing the project with Unity and Mirror Networking.</li>
            <li>Most of my work on the project consists of implementing game mechanics and multiplayer functionality.</li>

    title: "WebDoodler",
    desc: <ul>
            <li>WebDoodler is a little drawing app I built from scratch with pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.</li>
            <li>I originally created it for my programming studio final while in college. It was a solo project, and we had a total of 4 weeks to work on it.</li>
            <li>It features a basic brush, an eraser, a line tool, an eyedropper tool, a palette to save colors, variable brush sizes, a selection tool, a layer system, an undo button, a few basic filters, and a way to save images you made or upload your own image to work with.</li>
            <li>You can find the source code for it <a href="https://github.com/Theis97/Webdoodler">here</a>.</li>

            <li>I'm still in the process of polishing the site up.</li>
            <li>You can check out the source code for it <a href="https://github.com/Theis97/portfolio">here</a> if you'd like.</li>
