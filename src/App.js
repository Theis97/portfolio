          <p>
            I'm a {age} year old Software Developer living in the Chicago suburbs.
            I got my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the University
            of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where I was also a member of the
            Marching Illini (Go Illini!). In addition to programming, I also enjoy
            drawing, writing, playing video games, and obsessing over my favorite
            shows with my friends.
          </p>
          <p>
            My mission is to create software that makes the world a better place,
            whether that's by providing solutions for tough problems or by simply
            bringing people joy. Lately, I've been working with a small team to
            create a virtual reality experience that aims to promote the user's
            mental health and let them connect with other people. You can read
            more about it in the projects section.
